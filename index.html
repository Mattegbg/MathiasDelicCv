                <p>I am a former salesperson (B2B and B2C) with a track record of achieving great results. I excel in social settings and enjoy working both independently and as part of a team with a shared goal. 
                    My passion for the IT industry led me to pursue a Frontend Development education from August 2021 to June 2023. </p>
                <p>Currently, I am completing an internship (November 2022 to May 2023) at 'Input Interiör' as part of my school program. 
                    While I enjoy Frontend Development, I am also keen to learn more about Backend Development (Full-stack), SEO, and Digital Marketing.
                    I am interested in exploring leadership opportunities and other challenges in the future. 
                </p>
                <p>In addition to my education, I am also taking courses in WordPress and Project Management.</p>
